; Define a higher order procedure that:
; - is called `my-identity` and simulates the `identity` procedure;
; - accepts a procedure and returns a lambda that accepts an argument and applies that procedure to it;
; - accepts a predicate and returns a lambda that accepts an argument and applies the negated predicate to it;
; - accepts two procedures and returns their composition over an argument of a lambda procedure;
; - returns a procedure that is the partial application of f over x.
